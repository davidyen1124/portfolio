_Please maintain complete silence in the gallery. No running, no food, and absolutely no touching the exhibits with your grubby little fingers._

## 🎨 What's This Masterpiece?

Behold, a groundbreaking innovation in personal portfolio presentation! Instead of boring you with yet another static webpage filled with buzzwords and stock photos, I've created an actual 3D museum. Because why list your projects when you can force people to _walk_ through them, right?

## 🎮 How to Navigate This Pretentious Gallery

1. **WASD/Arrow Keys** - For those cultured enough to know how to walk
2. **Mouse** - Wave it around like you're conducting an orchestra
3. **Click** - To interact with the exhibits (yes, you're actually allowed to touch these)
4. **Paintings** - They're not NFTs, I promise. Click them to interact
5. **Mobile Users** - Virtual joysticks appear for those who prefer their art on-the-go

## 🎵 Special Exhibition

Keep an eye out for the special Spotify exhibit! It's like those audio guides at museums, but actually playing something you might want to listen to.

## ⚡ Features

- Fully immersive 3D experience (because 2D is so last century)
- Real-time GitHub repository displays (yes, I'm showing off)
- Spotify integration (because every gallery needs a soundtrack)
- Résumé sections displayed right on the gallery walls
- Fancy lighting and glossy floors (to make my code look better than it actually is)
- Mobile-friendly controls (art appreciation for the bus commute)
- Optimized performance (so your device doesn't burst into flames)
- No gift shop (sorry, not sorry)

## 🏃‍♂️ Quick Start

1. Visit [https://d.daviddennislinda.com](https://d.daviddennislinda.com)
2. Click to start
3. Get lost in the magnificence of my work
4. Try not to bump into the virtual walls

## 🤔 Why?

Because PowerPoint presentations are boring, and LinkedIn is... well, LinkedIn.

## 🎫 Admission Fee

Free! (But I accept GitHub stars as donations)

## 🚫 Museum Rules

- No flash photography
- No running in the corridors
- No asking "but why didn't you just use a normal website?"
- No pointing out that this is totally overengineered
- No complaining if your ancient device struggles with WebGL

## 👨‍💻 Curator

Created by David Yen, your friendly neighborhood code artist who clearly had too much time on their hands.
